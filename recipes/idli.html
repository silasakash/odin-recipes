        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>When one thinks of south-Indian food, the humble idli is the first dish that comes to mind. To the uninitiated, this is a savory rice cake that is made by steaming a fermented mixture of rice and pulses. Idlis can also be made with semolina. In fact, there are many different types of idlis. Some claim that there are over 1000 different variants of this delicacy. This dish is so popular that Match 30th is celebrated every year as World Idli Day.</p>
        <p>Though the idli is today recognized as a south-Indian delicacy, it may have originated elsewhere. No matter where it came from and the process of making it is one that was perfected only in South-India.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup Parboiled Rice (idli-dosa rice or short-grain rice)</li>
            <li>1 cup Basmati Rice (or any rice)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Whole Urad Dal (skinned) or split Urad Dal</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Poha (flattened rice / aval)</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon Fenugreek Seeds (methi)</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Oil, for greasing</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse urad dal and fenugreek seeds in water for 2-3 times.</li>
            <li>Soak urad dal, fenugreek seeds and poha (flattened rice) together in 1-cup water for 4-5 hours. (Dal’s size and volume would increase to almost double after soaking.)</li>
            <li>Rinse both parboiled and basmati rice together in water for 3-4 times. (Place both types of rice in a large bowl and fill it with water till ¾th height. Rub rice grains between your fingers; this will make water turn cloudy. Drain the water and repeat the process for 3-4 times to rinse them properly.) Soak them together in 2-cups of water for around 4-5 hours.</li>
            <li>Drain excess water from soaked urad dal and reserve it to use in grinding process in next step. Transfer drained dal and fenugreek seeds into large jar of mixer grinder or wet grinder.</li>
            <li>Add 1/2 cup water (preserved in step-4) and grind until smooth texture. Gradually add more water (as needed) and grind until smooth and fluffy texture. To grind 1/2 cup urad dal, you would need approx. 1½ cup water. The amount of water required greatly depends on the quality of urad dal; so add water gradually and only as required. Ground dal mixture should have light and fluffy texture as shown in photo and it should not be very thin or very thick.</li>
            <li>Transfer it into a large container.</li>
            <li>Drain excess water from rice. Add drained rice in the same mixer-grinder or wet grinder jar.</li>
            <li>Add water in small quantities as needed (approx. 1/2 cup total) and grind until slightly coarse texture.</li>
            <li>Transfer ground rice mixture to the same container in which urad dal mixture is stored.</li>
            <li>Add salt and mix it well. Batter should not be very thick or very thin. Idlis will turn hard if batter is too thick, and idlis will turn flat if batter is too thin. Cover it with a plate and keep it in warm place (at room temperature in summer, and in warm place in winter) for 8-10 hours. If you are living in cold place, place the batter in oven and keep the oven light on.</li>
            <li>Size and volume of batter would increase as it ferments.</li>
            <li>Stir the fermented batter with a clean ladle or a large spoon. You should see the tiny air bubbles in the batter as shown in the photo. These tiny air bubbles are critical to make idlis soft and spongy.</li>
            <li>Check batter for salt and if required, add more salt and stir. Pour 1-2 glass water in the steamer and place it on the stove to heat over medium flame. Grease idli moulds with oil and pour batter over it.</li>
            <li>Place moulds in the steamer. Cover steamer with a lid and steam the idlis for 10 minutes over medium flame. Check whether idlis are cooked or not by inserting a knife or a toothpick in the center of idli take it out. If it comes out clean, it means idli is cooked; if it doesn’t, then idli is not cooked yet; steam it for 3-4 minutes more and check again.</li>
            <li>Remove idli moulds from the steamer and let them cool for few minutes. Remove idlis with a wet spoon; this will help you remove it easily from the mould.</li>
            <li>Transfer them to a plate or in a casserole and cover with a lid to keep them hot. Serve hot with sambar and coconut chutney in the breakfast.</li>
