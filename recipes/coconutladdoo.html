            <li>Stir and cook until the mixture turns thick, starts to leave the sides and forms into a big lump. It will take 4-5 minutes over low medium flame. Add 1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder.</li>
            <li>Mix well. Turn off the flame and let the mixture cools down for a while for around 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Take 1/4 cup desiccated coconut (dry grated coconut) in a small plate. When the mixture is little warm, take a small lemon sized portion from the mixture and give it the shape like ball.</li>
            <li>Roll that ball into the desiccated coconut until it coats well from all the sides.</li>
            <li>Transfer it to a plate. Make all the laddus in a similar way. Coconut laddus are ready for serving. Store coconut ladoo in an airtight container and keep it in the refrigerator. They stay good for a week.</li>
