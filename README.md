# odin-recipes
My first project made during the Foundations course on The Odin Project.

I learned the following things:-
1. I probably should have committed more often during the workflow.
2. Structuring images without css is hard.
3. commit messages need to be concise but constructive.
4. I can commit multiple files and folders in a directory with git add .
