# odin-recipes
My first project made during the Foundations course on The Odin Project.

I learned the following things:-
1. I probably should have committed more often during the workflow.
2. Structuring images without css is hard.
3. Commit messages need to be concise but constructive.
4. I can commit multiple files and folders in a directory with "git add .".
5. Pushing css caused the following error:
	hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
	hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
	hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
	hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
	hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
